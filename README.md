# Road Map
- 13.06.2022 - create models + basic CRUD operations - done
- 14.06.2022 - frontend visualization/routing -> list of custom queries


- 01.08:
  - set custom roles + use them in endpoints 
  - create relationships:
    - additional fields to models due to relationship? - NOT FOR NOW
    - friendship - DONE
    - owner - DONE
  - rating(relationship or list)
- 02-03.08 - fancy queries:
  - algorithm for recommendation
  - filtering - check if needed
  - querying by field(decide what will be needed)
- 04.08 - make openapi pretty - part of documentation


# FRONTEND

  - update data
  - add/list/delete friendship
- restaurator page:

# TODO:
